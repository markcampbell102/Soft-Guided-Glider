# The Soft Guided Glider

During disaster periods there are always areas which are more accessible from the air than from land due to damage to infrastructure after earthquakes or tsunamis. The purpose of this project was to build a low-cost glider that would be able to deliver vital supplies to people in need when they are in these difficult to reach locations. The Glider was designed to be compact, low cost, lightweight and soft. With these attributes it would be able to be thrown from a high altitude and land without damaging its intended cargo, the intended user or itself.
